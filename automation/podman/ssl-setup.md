 I'll help you set up Podman to use SSL certificates. There are a few ways to handle this depending on whether you need the certificates for registry access or within the containers.

1. First, let's set up the certificates directory structure:

```bash
# Create the necessary directories for certificates
mkdir -p ~/.config/containers/certs.d/
```

2. For registry certificates (if you're using a private registry), create a directory for your registry:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/containers/certs.d/your-registry.example.com
```

3. Copy your certificates:
```bash
# For registry certificates
cp your-certificate.crt ~/.config/containers/certs.d/your-registry.example.com/

# For CA certificates
cp your-ca.crt /etc/containers/certs.d/ca.crt
```

4. If you need to use certificates within containers, here's a Dockerfile example:



<antArtifact identifier="ssl-cert-dockerfile" type="application/vnd.ant.code" language="dockerfile" title="Dockerfile with SSL Certificate Configuration">
# Use a base image
FROM ubuntu:20.04

# Create certificate directories
RUN mkdir -p /usr/local/share/ca-certificates /etc/ssl/certs

# Copy certificates from build context
COPY ./certs/*.crt /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/

# Update CA certificates
RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get install -y ca-certificates && \
    update-ca-certificates && \
    apt-get clean && \
    rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Set environment variable for certificate verification
ENV SSL_CERT_DIR=/etc/ssl/certs
ENV SSL_CERT_FILE=/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt

# Your application commands here
CMD ["bash"]
</antArtifact>

5. To run a container with certificates mounted:
```bash
podman run -v /path/to/your/certs:/etc/ssl/certs:ro your-image
```

6. If you're using Podman Machine on Windows, you'll need to configure the certificates in the VM:
```powershell
# Stop the podman machine
podman machine stop

# SSH into the podman machine
podman machine ssh

# Copy certificates (from another terminal)
podman machine ssh copy /path/to/your/cert.crt /etc/ssl/certs/

# Update certificates in the VM
sudo update-ca-certificates

# Exit and restart the machine
exit
podman machine start
```

7. To verify certificate configuration:
```bash
# Test registry access
podman pull your-registry.example.com/your-image

# Test certificate within container
podman run your-image curl https://your-secure-endpoint.com
```

Common troubleshooting steps:

1. Check certificate permissions:
```bash
chmod 644 ~/.config/containers/certs.d/*/*.crt
```

2. Verify certificate format:
```bash
openssl x509 -in your-certificate.crt -text -noout
```

3. Check Podman's certificate configuration:
```bash
podman info
```

1. Show how to set up mutual TLS authentication?
2. Explain how to handle certificate rotation?
3. Demonstrate debugging certificate issues?
