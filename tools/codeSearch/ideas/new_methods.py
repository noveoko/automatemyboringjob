In Python, you can pass functions as arguments to create new functions, leveraging the concept of higher-order functions. This is a powerful feature of Python that allows for more flexible and abstract coding patterns. Here's how you can do it:

1. **Define a Function That Accepts Another Function as an Argument**: Create a function that takes another function as a parameter. This higher-order function can then call the passed function internally.

2. **Pass a Function as an Argument**: When you call the higher-order function, pass the function you want to be executed as an argument.

Here's an example to illustrate this:

```python
def multiply_by_two(x):
    return x * 2

def add_five(x):
    return x + 5

def apply_function(func, value):
    return func(value)

# Using the higher-order function
result1 = apply_function(multiply_by_two, 10)  # This will be 20
result2 = apply_function(add_five, 10)  # This will be 15
```

In this example, `apply_function` is a higher-order function that takes another function (`func`) and a value (`value`) as arguments. It applies the function to the value and returns the result. You can pass any function that takes a single argument to `apply_function`, making it a versatile way to apply different operations to a value.

This pattern is quite common in Python, especially in functional programming paradigms. It allows for creating more generic, reusable code and can be particularly powerful in data processing, mathematical computations, and more.
