Certainly! An industry-standard approach often involves using fixtures to set up and clean up resources. Here's an updated `pytest` test using fixtures:

```python
import os
import pytest
from your_module import verify_file_contains_keyword

@pytest.fixture
def test_file_path():
    path = "test_file.txt"
    yield path
    # Teardown: remove the file after the test
    os.remove(path)

def test_verify_file_contains_keyword(test_file_path):
    keyword = "example_keyword"

    # Write to the file
    with open(test_file_path, "w") as f:
        f.write("This is a sample file with example_keyword.")

    # Test the function
    assert verify_file_contains_keyword(test_file_path, keyword) is None
```

In this example, the `test_file_path` fixture yields the path to the test file. After the test function completes, the fixture teardown removes the file. This approach helps maintain a clean testing environment.
