Here is the most relevant sentence in the context: To capture a `div` that appears after another element is clicked, you can use the event delegation approach by attaching an event listener to a common parent of both elements.

```javascript
// Assuming there is a common parent element with id "commonParent"
const commonParent = document.getElementById('commonParent');

// Add click event listener to the common parent
commonParent.addEventListener('click', function(event) {
  // Check if the clicked element is the trigger element
  if (event.target.id === 'yourTriggerElementId') {
    // Your code to handle the appearance of the div
    console.log('Trigger element clicked, capture the dynamically created div');
    
    // Access the dynamically created div (replace 'yourDynamicDivId' accordingly)
    const dynamicallyCreatedDiv = document.getElementById('yourDynamicDivId');
    if (dynamicallyCreatedDiv) {
      // Your code to handle the dynamically created div
      console.log('Captured the dynamically created div:', dynamicallyCreatedDiv);
    }
  }
});
```

Replace `'yourTriggerElementId'` and `'yourDynamicDivId'` with the actual IDs of the trigger element and the dynamically created `div`. This way, you can capture the click event on the common parent and check if the clicked element is the trigger element.
