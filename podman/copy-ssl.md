 I'll show you how to copy certificates from Windows into Podman. Since Podman on Windows runs in a WSL environment, we'll need to transfer the certificates properly.

Here are two methods:

1. Using Podman Machine SSH:
```powershell
# First, locate your certificate on Windows (example path)
# C:\Users\YourUser\certificates\your-cert.crt

# Copy the certificate to the Podman machine
podman machine ssh copy C:\Users\YourUser\certificates\your-cert.crt /etc/ssl/certs/
```

2. Alternative method using PowerShell to read and paste:
```powershell
# Read the certificate content
$cert = Get-Content -Path "C:\Users\YourUser\certificates\your-cert.crt"

# Create a temporary file with Unix line endings
$cert | Set-Content -Path "$env:TEMP\temp-cert.crt" -NoNewline

# Copy into Podman machine
podman machine ssh "cat > /etc/ssl/certs/your-cert.crt" < "$env:TEMP\temp-cert.crt"

# Update certificates in Podman machine
podman machine ssh "sudo update-ca-certificates"

# Restart Podman machine
podman machine stop
podman machine start
```

To verify the certificate was copied correctly:
```powershell
# Check if certificate exists in Podman machine
podman machine ssh "ls -l /etc/ssl/certs/your-cert.crt"

# View certificate content
podman machine ssh "cat /etc/ssl/certs/your-cert.crt"
```

If you need to manage multiple certificates or want to automate this process, I can show you a PowerShell script to handle that. Would that be helpful?
