 I'll help you learn how to use Podman on Windows. Let me guide you through the setup and basic usage.

First, you'll need to install Podman. On Windows, this involves:

1. Install Windows Subsystem for Linux 2 (WSL2):
```powershell
wsl --install
```

2. Install Podman using Windows Package Manager (winget):
```powershell
winget install -e RedHat.Podman
```

After installation, open PowerShell and initialize Podman:
```powershell
podman machine init
podman machine start
```

Here are some basic commands to get you started:

1. Pull an image:
```powershell
podman pull ubuntu
```

2. Run a container:
```powershell
podman run -it ubuntu bash
```

3. List running containers:
```powershell
podman ps
```

4. List all containers (including stopped):
```powershell
podman ps -a
```

5. Stop a container:
```powershell
podman stop <container_id>
```

6. Remove a container:
```powershell
podman rm <container_id>
```

Would you like me to explain any specific aspect of Podman or show you how to do more advanced operations like creating custom images or working with volumes?
