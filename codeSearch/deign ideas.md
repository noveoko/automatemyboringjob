Standard Checks:Row and Column Counts: Verify the number of rows and columns. Unexpected counts can indicate missing or extra data.Data Types: Check data types of each column. Data type mismatches (like strings in a numeric column) can highlight conversion errors or corrupt data.Missing Values: Identify and quantify missing or null values. High levels of missing data in crucial columns may impact data quality.Duplicate Rows: Detect and report duplicate rows. Duplicates can skew analysis results.Statistical Profiling:Summary Statistics: Generate summary statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, etc.) for numerical columns.Value Distribution: Analyze the distribution of values in each column, looking for unexpected spikes, gaps, or patterns.Outlier Detection: Implement methods to detect outliers in the data. This can be based on statistical thresholds or domain-specific criteria.Consistency Checks:Referential Integrity: If your dataset is supposed to relate to other datasets, check for referential integrity.Data Format Validation: Verify that data formats (like dates, phone numbers, etc.) are consistent and correct.Categorical Data Validation: For categorical data, check if the values fall within the expected set of categories.Historical Data Comparison:Compare current data with historical data to detect significant deviations or trends that might indicate data issues.Business Rule Validation:Implement checks based on known business rules or constraints specific to the dataâ€™s domain.Data Profiling and Exploration:Use data profiling tools to explore the data and uncover patterns or anomalies.Implement machine learning algorithms for anomaly detection in more complex scenarios.Automate and Integrate:Automate the checks as much as possible.Integrate the checks into your data ingestion or ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipelines.Reporting and Alerting:Generate reports summarizing the data quality checks.Implement alerting mechanisms for critical issues that need immediate attention.Feedback Loop for Continuous Improvement:Establish a feedback loop to continually refine data quality checks based on new findings and evolving data schemas.Documentation and Governance:Document the data quality process and criteria.Implement data governance policies to maintain data quality over time.
