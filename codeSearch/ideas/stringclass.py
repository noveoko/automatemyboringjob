Certainly! You can create a data class with a property and a setter method for validation. Here's an example:

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class ValidatedString:
    _value: str = ""

    @property
    def value(self):
        return self._value

    @value.setter
    def value(self, new_value):
        # Add your validation logic here
        if not isinstance(new_value, str):
            raise ValueError("Value must be a string.")
        
        # Additional validation logic can be added as needed

        # If validation passes, update the value
        self._value = new_value
```

Now, you can use this `ValidatedString` data class, and the validation will be triggered each time you try to update its value:

```python
validated_str = ValidatedString()
validated_str.value = "Hello, this is valid."  # This will update the value

# This will raise a ValueError due to the validation logic in the setter
validated_str.value = 42
```

Adjust the validation logic inside the setter according to your specific requirements.
