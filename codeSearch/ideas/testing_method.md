1. **Not Using Fixtures for Setup/Teardown**
   - Mistake: Manually setting up and tearing down resources.
   - Better:
     ```python
     @pytest.fixture
     def resource():
         setup()
         yield
         teardown()
     ```

2. **Using `unittest.TestCase` with `pytest`**
   - Mistake: Mixing `unittest.TestCase` methods with `pytest` features.
   - Better: Use plain functions with `pytest` fixtures.

3. **Hardcoding File Paths in Tests**
   - Mistake: `open('path/to/file')`
   - Better: Use `tmp_path` fixture for temporary files/directories.

4. **Skipping Parameterization**
   - Mistake: Writing separate test functions for similar tests.
   - Better:
     ```python
     @pytest.mark.parametrize("input,expected", [(1, 2), (2, 3)])
     def test_increment(input, expected):
         assert increment(input) == expected
     ```

5. **Ignoring Pytest's Assert Introspection**
   - Mistake: Using `assertEqual(a, b)` instead of `assert a == b`

6. **Not Utilizing Marks for Test Categorization**
   - Mistake: Not categorizing tests.
   - Better: Use marks like `@pytest.mark.slow` to categorize tests.

7. **Overusing `pytest.raises`**
   - Mistake: Using `pytest.raises(Exception)`.
   - Better: Be specific about the exception type.

8. **Ignoring Test Isolation**
   - Mistake: Shared state between tests.
   - Better: Use fixtures for isolated state.

9. **Confusing Test Discovery Rules**
   - Mistake: Naming tests incorrectly (tests should start with `test_` or end with `_test`).

10. **Misusing Scope in Fixtures**
    - Mistake: Incorrectly scoping fixtures.
    - Better:
      ```python
      @pytest.fixture(scope="module")
      def module_fixture():
          # setup
          yield
          # teardown
      ```

11. **Not Using Mocks for External Services**
    - Mistake: Hitting actual external services in tests.
    - Better: Use `unittest.mock` or `pytest-mock`.

12. **Ignoring Warnings**
    - Mistake: Allowing warnings to go unchecked.
    - Better: Use `pytest.warns` to assert warnings.

13. **Missing `__init__.py` in Test Directories**
    - Mistake: Not recognizing test modules due to missing `__init__.py`.

14. **Relying on Test Execution Order**
    - Mistake: Writing tests that depend on the order of execution.
    - Better: Ensure each test is independent.

15. **Using `assert` with No Message**
    - Mistake: Using plain `assert condition`.
    - Better: Provide an informative message, `assert condition, "Error message"`.

16. **Ignoring Test Coverage Tools**
    - Mistake: Not checking test coverage.
    - Better: Integrate with a tool like `pytest-cov`.

17. **Not Utilizing Logging**
    - Mistake: Not adding logging in tests.
    - Better: Use Python's logging module to log in tests.

18. **Forgetting to Test Exceptions**
    - Mistake: Only testing the happy path.
    - Better: Also test for expected exceptions.

19. **Ignoring Conftest for Shared Fixtures**
    - Mistake: Repeating fixture code across test files.
    - Better: Use `conftest.py` for shared fixtures.

20. **Not Keeping Tests Simple and Focused**
    - Mistake: Writing complex and doing too much in one test.
    - Better: Aim for simplicity and focus in each test.

These examples cover various aspects of using `pytest`, from fixtures and parameterization to test organization and best practices. Avoiding these mistakes can lead to cleaner, more efficient, and more reliable test suites.
