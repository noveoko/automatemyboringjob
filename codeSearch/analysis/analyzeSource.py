To create a Python script that scans another Python file to identify code coverage, code complexity, coupling between objects, and response for class, you will need to use various libraries. Here's a breakdown of what each term means and the libraries that can be used:

1. **Code Coverage**: This measures how much of your code is being tested by your unit tests. A popular tool for this in Python is `coverage.py`.

2. **Code Complexity**: This measures how complex your code is, often in terms of cyclomatic complexity. Tools like `radon` or `McCabe` can be used for this purpose.

3. **Coupling Between Objects**: This measures the degree to which each class relies on other classes. There isn't a direct tool for this in Python, but you can use principles from static code analysis tools like `pylint` or `flake8`.

4. **Response for Class (RFC)**: This metric measures the number of methods python
# install coverage, radon... 

import os
import subprocess
import radon.complexity as complexity
from radon.cli import Config
from radon.cli.tools import iter_filenames

def analyze_python_file(file_path):
    # Code coverage analysis
    subprocess.run(['coverage', 'run', file_path])
    subprocess.run(['coverage', 'report'])

    # Code complexity and RFC analysis
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        content = file.read()
        results = complexity.cc_visit(content)
        rfc_results = complexity.rfc_visit(content)

        print("\nCode Complexity:")
        for result in results:
            print(f"{result.classname}.{result.name}: Complexity {result.complexity}")

        print("\nResponse for Class (RFC):")
        for result in rfc_results:
            print(f"{result.classname}: RFC {result.rfc}")

    # Coupling between objects (basic static analysis)
    subprocess.run(['pylint', file_path])

file_path = 'path_to_your_python_file.py'
analyze_python_file(file_path)
